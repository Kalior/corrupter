# corrupter
Simple image glitcher suitable for producing nice looking i3lock backgrounds

## Getting Started

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/r00tman/corrupter
$ cd corrupter && go build
$ ./corrupter -h
$ ./corrupter shots/test2.png out.png && xdg-open out.png
```

At the moment, you can only pass and output png images. But that's enough to work well with scrot and i3lock
